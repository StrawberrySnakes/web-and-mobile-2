                Unix is an operating system that provides a platform for running software and managing computer hardware. It was developed in the late 1960s and 1970s at Bell Labs. Unix is known for its multitasking, multi-user capabilities, and its emphasis on simplicity and flexibility in design. It has influenced the development of many modern operating systems and remains widely used in various forms, including Linux and macOS.
